<h2>What is Artificial Intelligence:</h2>
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart
machines capable of performing tasks thattypically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary
science with multiple approaches,but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm
shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.

<h2>HOW IS AI USED:</h2>
Artificial intelligence generally falls under two broad categories: 
Narrow AI: Sometimes referred to as "Weak AI," this kind of artificial intelligence operates within a limited context 
and is a simulation of human intelligence. Narrow AI is often focused on performing a single task ext
remely well and while these machines may seem intelligent, they are operating under far more constraints
and limitations than even the most basic human intelligence.

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): AGI, sometimes referred to as "Strong AI," is the kind of artificial intelligenc
e we see in the movies, like the robots from Westworld or Data from Star Trek:
The Next Generation. AGI is a machine with general intelligence and, much like a human being, it can apply 
that intelligence to solve any problem.

<h2>HISTORY OF AI:</h2>
Intelligent robots and artificial beings first appeared in the ancient Greek myths of Antiquity. 
Aristotle's development of the syllogism and it's use of deductive reasoning was a key moment in mankind's quest to understand its own intelligence.
While the roots are long and deep, the history of artificial intelligence as we think of it today spans less than a century.
The following is a quick look at some of the most important events in AI.
